# Flashcards
Hey fellas!

This is a fork and fix so the Flashcards will work with the new Obsidian Properties update.

Essentially, you wanna look at the code? Look at the fixed Code.

You want to install the fixed plugin?

## Installing the Fixed Plugin.
1. In your target vault, there is a hidden directory called `.obsidian`. This directory contains all the information that makes your vault unique.
2. Navigate to this directory, then go to the plugins folder.
3. Copy the vault in this repository labelled 'flashcards-obsidian' into the `.obsidian/plugins` directory.
4. Restart Obsidian and see how it goes!

## Notes
Feel free to chuck an Issue in the vault should there be anything wrong with the steps provided, or if it just doesn't work.

Thanks to @reuseman for the initial plugin, and to @chaecramb for the fix.

Hopefully this will tie over any folk in exam prep.

Happy studying!
